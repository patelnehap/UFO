# UFO Sightings

## Overview
Dana, a data journalist was given the oppurtunity to write an article about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. Dana is excited about this oppurtunity not only because its her hometown but its also the largest city in Yamhill County filled with UFO sightings enthusiasts. Dana herself was also very much interested in the UFO Sightings since her childhood when she heard about the UFO being spotted at Farmer Trent's farm. She has a javascript file with various UFO sighting details which she needs to analyze and present through a web page as its an online article. Dana wants her web page to be visually appealing and interactive meaning it will react to user input. Dana can accomplish this with the help of HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and Javascript languages.

### Results:

Dana was able to create a visually appealing and interactive webpage. She started with a bold heading with a beautiful background nasa image, followed by her article on UFO sightings being a fact or fantasy with a title on the left and an informational summary on the left.

 She displayed the various UFO sightings neatly displayed in a table with data stacked appropriately in related columns. She added various filters to help the users refine their results to specific UFO sightings they may be interested in. The search can be narrowed down either by specific Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

Since Dana was specifically interested in her home state OR, she entered OR in the city filter to ffilter the results just for Oregon state. Below were here results:

Dana was also specifically interested in sphere shaped UFO sightings on the new year day, so she entered the 1/1/2010 date in the date filter and sphere in the Shape filter to get the specific results:

### Summary
Dana was  very impressed and satisfied with her web page. She was able to get the results she was looking for and also the web page was visually appealing. Also the filters where users can refine the search as per their needs were very intriguing. But she felt that the filters were defaulting to the placeholder values from our HTML code. The default values were very visible and confusing to some users. She needs to dig a little more deeper into the code to get rid of the placeholder values. Some users requested a range input for the date filter, Dana wanted to further look into that development as well. Adding a range in the date filter would allow the users to filter for a week or weekends as needed.
